Practice Repository

Welcome! 👋
This repository is created for practicing Git and GitHub.

I’m using this space to learn and revise:

Git commands (commit, push, pull, branching, merging)

GitHub workflows

Pull requests & collaboration

Managing repositories and version control basics

Feel free to ignore the contents — this repo is mainly for my learning and experimentation or you can use it if this helps...
I’ll keep updating it as I improve. 🚀
Thankyou
